# Marketing Partner Onboarding – Tiers & Commission

Use this for **internal** (staff/ops) and **external** (partner) onboarding so everyone has the same numbers.

---

## Commission Tiers

| Tier | Paid clients | Commission per hour |
|------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Silver Partner** | 1–5 paid clients | **$1.00/hr** |
| **Gold Partner** | 6–10 paid clients | **$1.25/hr** |
| **Platinum Partner** | 11+ paid clients | **$1.50/hr** |

- **Paid client** = a client who has actually paid (e.g. charge recorded for a session, or booking with payment status “paid”). Only these count toward your tier.
- Your tier is updated automatically from your paid client count. You don’t need to do anything to “move up.”
- Your **current tier rate** is applied to each hour of care worked by clients you referred. Commission is calculated at clock-out and when payments are processed.

## Client Discount (unchanged)

- Clients who use your referral link/code get **$3/hour discount** on their booking.
- You do not need to show your exact commission rate in share messages; you can say you “earn commission when they book” if you like.

## Payouts

- **Schedule:** Weekly (every Friday).
- **Method:** Stripe Connect (bank or card). Partner must connect a payout method in the Marketing Dashboard.
