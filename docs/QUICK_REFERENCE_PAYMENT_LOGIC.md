# ⚡ QUICK REFERENCE - PAYMENT LOGIC

## 🎯 The Simple Version

### 3-Step Flow:
1. **Client pays YOU:** $45/hour (fixed)
2. **YOU assign caregiver rate:** $20-$50/hour (your choice within their range)
3. **YOU keep the difference** (minus 10% marketing + 15% training)

---

## 💵 Formula Cheat Sheet

```
Agency Gross Profit = (Client Rate - Assigned Rate) × Hours
Agency Net Profit = Gross Profit - (Client Total × 25%)

Where:
- Client Rate = $45/hr (standard)
- Assigned Rate = What YOU decide ($20-$50)
- Client Total × 25% = Commissions (10% + 15%)
```

## ✅ Before You Assign - Checklist

- [ ] Is rate within caregiver's preferred range?
- [ ] Will I make at least 5% profit?
- [ ] Is this caregiver worth this rate?
- [ ] Can I sustain this margin long-term?
- [ ] Have I calculated the total net profit?

## 📞 Quick Math

**Simple formula:**
```
Your Profit = (45 - Assigned Rate - 11.25) × Hours

Where 11.25 = $45 × 25% commissions
```

**Example:**
```
Assign $28/hr for 40 hours:
Profit = (45 - 28 - 11.25) × 40
Profit = 5.75 × 40
Profit = $230 ✅
```

---

## 🎓 Remember

- **Lower assignment = Higher profit** (but may lose good caregivers)
- **Higher assignment = Lower profit** (but better retention)
- **Balance is key** to sustainable business
- **Commission is fixed** regardless of what you pay caregiver
- **Client never sees** what you pay the caregiver

**Your power:** You control the rate per booking, giving you flexibility to optimize for profit, quality, or market conditions!
